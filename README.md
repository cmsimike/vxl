# vxl

yet another voxel renderer, pretty original.

# dependencies

depends on GLFW, GLEW, and GLM.

heavily uses the standard library.

# platforms

vxl has been tested and proven to work on windows 10 when compiled with vc++.

# current metrics

• takes about two milliseconds to generate the current test voxels.

• about seven hundred and sixty-two lines of code in all (includes code comments and header files).

• on my machine, the compiled executable is 60kb when compiled.
